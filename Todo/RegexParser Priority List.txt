RegexParser - priority list:

- backtracking matcher:
    * quantifiers
    - separation of tests (ExplicitDFA / Backtracking); turn on/off ALL tests at once, for a particular algorithm
    - lazy quantifiers

[-explicit DFA matcher:
    - build NFA state machine (from pattern AST)
    - transform state machine from NFA to DFA
    - quantifiers
    - alternations
   [- lazy quantifiers]]

[-implicit DFA matcher]

- anchors: ^, $, \b, \B
- Regex options: IgnoreCase, IgnorePatternWhitespace, Multiline, Singleline
- miscellaneous constructs: (?#comment), (?i)

- error handling when parsing the pattern

- captures and capturing groups
- named groups
- backreferences

- look-ahead and look-behind (positive and negative)

- Replace()
- substitution patterns (starting with '$')

- Unicode:
    - Unicode categories and named blocks (char classes)
	- RegexOption: canonical (Unicode) or ECMAScript/JavaScript (ASCII) behavior
