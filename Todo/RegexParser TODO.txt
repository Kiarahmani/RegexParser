RegexParser TODO:

- RegexParsers: "unify" all group patterns that are part of various patterns (alternation, quantifier, etc.) (groups are similar, except for each excluding their own parent pattern)

- replace the use of 'string' in Result<char, string> with an immutable class which stores all 'Value' chars in a tree structure (with cheap 'append', and branch re-use); maybe revive the idea of a non-deterministic parser (as in the 'experimental' Git branch) (Value is not a single string/char tree, but a list of them, possibly empty); replace the current implementation of backtracking
