Parsing a pattern of the form "^...^" creates this many AnchorPatterns:

^'s:		AnchorPatterns:
1			 4
2			10
3			18
4			28
5			40
6			54
7			70



Related to this TODO item:

- "integrate" the parsing of various groups (quantifier, alternation, etc.), so that there are less "dead ends" during parsing (e.g., parsing "^^^^^^^" creates an AnchorPattern(StartOfStringOrLine) 70 times)
