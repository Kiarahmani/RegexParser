Big:

- Build a parse tree for the pattern (lexical and syntactic analysis).

- For the backtracking algorithm (like the .NET Framework's): build an input string matcher capabable of bactracking.

-~For the explicit/implicit DFA algorithms: build a state machine.
-~For the explicit DFA algorithm: transform the NFA state machine into a DFA one (powerset construction).



Features:

- basic language elements (no backtracking): ordinary chars, char escapes, quantifiers, char classes, alternation constructs, anchors, comments, non-capturing grouping

- lazy quantification

- captures and capturing groups

- substitutions

- backreferences

- non-ASCII (Unicode) encodings



Small:

- A parser should be generic (type-wise) on the determinism/non-determinism of the result, similar to Haskell’s Maybe and List monads, respectively. This is needed because the pattern (the regex language) will be parsed deterministically, whereas the input string, non-deterministically.
